### July 6, 2022
We have enabled the additional FHIR _sort parameter "_lastUpdated" for the following R4 resources: Condition, Patient, Location, Organization, Practitioner, and PractitionerRole. The _sort parameter lets you specify the arrangement of responses in ascending or descending order by certain other parameters.

---
### June 21, 2022
The Veteran's Health API (FHIR) has been renamed to the Patient Health API (FHIR). We've also updated the layout of this API's documentation, which replaces the FHIR specification tabs with a dropdown. These changes will help our consumers more easily identify the use cases of this and our other health APIs. 

There are no other changes to functionality, requests/responses, or data.

We have also enabled an additional FHIR _sort parameter for the R4 AllergyIntolerance and DiagnosticReport resources. The _sort parameter lets you specify the arrangement of responses in ascending or descending order by certain other parameters.
 - 'AllergyIntolerance' can now be sorted by _lastUpdated.
 - 'DiagnosticReport' can now be sorted by _lastUpdated.

---
### May 24, 2022
We have enabled the FHIR _sort parameter for the R4 'Condition', 'DiagnosticReport', and 'Location' resources. The _sort parameter lets you specify the arrangement of responses in ascending or descending order by certain other parameters.
 - 'Condition' can be sorted by category and clinical-status.
 - 'DiagnosticReport' can be sorted by date.
 - 'Location' can be sorted by address, address-city, address-state, address-postalcode, and name.

---
### May 17, 2022
To better meet the FHIR specification for the Veterans and Clinical Health APIs, we've made some changes to the Organization.type properties for DSTU2 and R4.
 - We will now return the type property for only insurance companies, government agencies, and VA facilities.
 - We are now using [FHIR-standard Organization type codes](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/codesystem-organization-type.html) in the organization.type field to communicate the government and insurance organization types.
 - There are no changes to how the organization type is returned for VA facilities. 

---
### May 3, 2022
We added a new FHIR R4 resource to the [Veterans Health API (FHIR)](https://developer.va.gov/explore/health/docs/fhir?version=current), [DeviceRequest](http://www.hl7.org/Fhir/devicerequest.html), which supports READ and SEARCH functionality. This resource includes only CPAP and BiPAP data.

We also enabled the FHIR _sort parameter for the R4 'Observation', 'Encounter', and 'Appointment' resources. The _sort parameter lets you specify the arrangement of responses in ascending or descending order by certain other parameters. 
 - 'Observation' can be sorted by category, code, date, and _lastUpdated.
 - 'Encounter' can be sorted by date and _lastUpdated.
 - 'Appointment' can be sorted by date and _lastUpdated.

---
### April 12, 2022
We have made backend changes to the Veterans Health API that optimize performance, promote stability, and reduce maintenance efforts for the R4 and DSTU2 AllergyIntolerance and Procedure resources. As a result, AllergyIntolerance and Procedure identifiers have changed. The identifier changes do not impact consumers as all cross-resource references remain valid and old identifiers are honored for read operations. 

---
### February 24, 2022
To better meet the R4 FHIR specification for both the Veterans Health and Clinical Health APIs, we will replace the full US state name with the [USPS Two Letter Abbreviation](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet-us-core-usps-state.html) in the R4 Patient resource. For example, `Texas` will be listed as `TX` and `Massachusetts` will be listed as `MA`. Consumers currently using DSTU2 will not be impacted by this change.

---
### February 10, 2022
Added support to allow `identifier` search by Integration Control Number (ICN) in the R4 `Practitioner` resource.  You can now search by either ICN or National Provider Identifier (NPI) using `identifier`.

---
### January 27, 2022
The `manufacturer.display` field has been updated in the R4 `Immunization` resource. This field is populated based on CVX to manufacturer mappings from the [CDC Product Names to CVX and MVX code set](https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/vaccines.asp?rpt=tradename). In cases where a CVX code maps to multiple manufacturers, the exact manufacturer can't be determined and thus `manufacturer.display` will be omitted from the response.

---
### January 13, 2022
Added FHIR R4 `Encounter` Resource data, which includes the ability to search by `patient`, `date`, and `_lastUpdated` date.

The `vaccineCode` field in the R4 `Immunization` resource now includes the Vaccine Short Description as well as the Vaccine Group Code and Name based on the [CDC CVX to Vaccine Groups code set](https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/vaccines.asp?rpt=vg).

Added support for `_lastUpdated` search in the R4 `Observation` resource.

---
### January 10, 2022
We changed the `referenceRange` data field that is returned with the `Observation` resource.
 - It no longer returns the field `high` or `low` if there is not an associated value.
 - It now returns the `system`, `code`, and `unit` fields only if all data are present.   

---
### December 13, 2021
Added support for `_lastUpdated` search in both the DSTU2 and R4 `Procedure` resource.

Integrated a new data source that contains COVID Vaccination data for VA Employees who received their vaccinations at a VA Facility.  This data is now available in the `Immunization` resource.  

---
### November 16, 2021
Added `qualification.code.text` and `address.period` data fields to the `Practitioner` resource.

Added the `code.text` data field to the `PractitionerRole` resource.  

---
### September 21, 2021
We added new elements and values to the R4 `Condition` FHIR mapping. 
  -  The `clinicalStatus` element now supports the value `inactive`.
  -  The `verificationStatus` element now returns these additional values:`provisional`, `differential`, `confirmed`, and `refuted`. Previously, this element always returned  `unconfirmed`.
  -  The `recorder` element is now added.

The R4 `AllergyIntolerance` FHIR mapping now includes both `clincalStatus` and `verificationStatus`.  Previously, only one was populated based on value. 

The `primarySource` for the R4 `Immunization` FHIR mapping now supports Boolean values. Previously, it was always `true`.

---
### August 24, 2021
Added the `code` data to the R4 `AllergyIntolerance` resource to be compliant with [US Core Implementation Guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-allergyintolerance.html).

Updated the `Condition` resource to include [SNOMED CT](http://snomed.info/sct) and ICD-10-CM codings when both are available.

---
### May 4, 2021
Added an `identifier` to the `Organization` resource to represent the VA Facility to be consistent with the Facility ID used by the Facilities API. For example a VAMC has an identifier of the form `vha_[stationNumber]` like `vha_673`.

Added an `identifier` to the `Location` resource to represent the VA clinic. This `identifier` has the form `vha_[stationNumber]_[clinic identifier]`.

---
### February 24, 2021
Added the FHIR R4 resource `Appointment`, which includes the ability to search appointments by `Patient` and `Location` references and searching by `_lastUpdated` date.

---
### December 15, 2020
The following three R4 resources have been made available: `Device`, `Practitioner`, and `PractitionerRole`. Not all US Core searches are yet supported for `Practitioner` and `PractitionerRole`.

The hold times for `Immunization` and COVID 19 Lab Results have been eliminated.

---
### August 31, 2020
In adherence to changes per the [21st Century Cures Act](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/05/01/2020-07419/21st-century-cures-act-interoperability-information-blocking-and-the-onc-health-it-certification#h-13), the Veteran Health API profile, in line with the US Core Implementation Guide has added FHIR R4 resources to the R4 tab. 

---
### August 7, 2020

We have updated the mock health records for test users in the Sandbox environment for the Veterans Health API `Condition` resource to list conditions from either SNOMED-CT or ICD-10 code sets.  Previously only SNOMED-CT codes were available.

---

### July 31, 2020
We are decreasing the data hold time for the Veterans Health API from 72 hours to 36 hours, effective July 31, 2020, based on an updated VHA policy.  When a physician enters or changes patient data, there is a holding period before the data is released and visible through other applications such as health apps. The holding period gives physicians time to contact their patients and discuss health data, such as sensitive diagnoses, before the patient sees this data elsewhere. This change applies only to real data entered into the production environment.

---

### July 13, 2020
The CoverageEligibilityResponse resource for Urgent Care is deprecated and scheduled for deactivation in the 3rd quarter of 2020.
We are working on new FHIR R4 resources and will add those in the 3rd quarter of 2020.

---

### June 10, 2020 {#june-10-2020-fhir}
The optional query parameter `prompt` has been added to the authorization flow.
- Supported prompts: login. If specified, the user will be forced to provide credentials regardless of session state. If omitted, an existing active session with the identity provider may not require the user to provide credentials.
