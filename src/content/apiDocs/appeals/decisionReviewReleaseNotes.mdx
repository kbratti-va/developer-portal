## June 17, 2022

We recently deprecated the higher_level_reviews endpoint for the [Decision Reviews API V1](https://developer.va.gov/explore/appeals/docs/decision_reviews?version=1.0.0). This endpoint is now removed, and its documentation is no longer available.
Consumers who were using this endpoint may instead use the following 2 new endpoints in the [Decision Reviews API V2](https://developer.va.gov/explore/appeals/docs/decision_reviews?version=current):
 - Higher_level_reviews
 - Legacy_appeals

### April 20, 2022
We added functionality to our Higher-Level Review (HLR) POST endpoint to support submissions by non-Veteran claimants. This allows HLRs to be submitted by dependents of a Veteran.

To learn more, read the [Decision Reviews API documentation](https://developer.va.gov/explore/appeals/docs/decision_reviews?version=current).

### April 18, 2022 
We added 5 new endpoints to the Decision Reviews API. These endpoints allow you to: 

Submit a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995). Structured data is submitted to the API which generates the most recent version of the PDF claim. 
Upload supporting evidence documents in PDF form with the Supplemental Claim.

Release Notes for new Contestable Issues standalone endpoint

We added a new endpoint (`GET /contestable_issues/{decision_review_type}`) to the Decision Reviews API. This endpoint returns contestable issues for a specific Veteran. Using this endpoint lets you tailor your appeal submission flow based on the Veteran’s issues. 

This endpoint returns contestable issues for a single Veteran based on the Veteran’s social security number.
You can search for contestable issues based on these appeal types: higher_level_reviews, notice_of_disagreements, and supplemental_claims. 
The endpoint returns only issues that have been decided as of the receiptDate. 
Read the Decision Review API documentation to learn more.

Decision Reviews API version 2 Release Notes

Version 2 of the Decision Reviews API is now released with the following changes:

We've added a new key, `informalConferenceContact` (required when an informal conference is requested), which will allow us to support both Veteran and representative contacts for informal conferences.
We've updated the possible responses enum of `informalConferenceTime` to reflect the above  changes.
`socOptIn` is now required.
For the representative name, we've split `name` into `firstName` and `lastName` to be more flexible and allow more accurate entries.
The Veteran email field `emailAddressText` has been changed to `email`.

Added hlrCreateAddress to now accept an address for this API. This change follows NOD format:
-`addressLine1`
-`addressLine2`
-`addressLine3`
-`city`
-`stateCode` - enum of all 2-character state codes (see the documentation for more info)
-`countryCodeISO2`
-`zipCode5`
