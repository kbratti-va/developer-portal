This endpoint returns contestable issues for a specific Veteran. Using this endpoint lets you tailor your appeal submission flow based on the Veteran’s issues. \n\nThis endpoint returns contestable issues for a single Veteran based on the Veteran’s social security number.\nYou can search for contestable issues based on these appeal types: higher_level_reviews, notice_of_disagreements, and supplemental_claims. \nThe endpoint returns only issues that have been decided as of the receiptDate. \nRead the Decision Review API documentation to learn more.\n\n\n---\n\n### July 26, 2021\n\nDecision Reviews API version 2 Release Notes\n\nVersion 2 of the Decision Reviews API is now released with the following changes:\n\nWe've added a new key, `informalConferenceContact` (required when an informal conference is requested), which will allow us to support both Veteran and representative contacts for informal conferences.\nWe've updated the possible responses enum of `informalConferenceTime` to reflect the above  changes.\n`socOptIn` is now required.\nFor the representative name, we've split `name` into `firstName` and `lastName` to be more flexible and allow more accurate entries.\nThe Veteran email field `emailAddressText` has been changed to `email`.\n\nAdded hlrCreateAddress to now accept an address for this API. This change follows NOD format:\n-`addressLine1`\n-`addressLine2`\n-`addressLine3`\n-`city`\n-`stateCode` - enum of all 2-character state codes (see the documentation for more info)\n-`countryCodeISO2`\n-`zipCode5`\n\n\n---\n\n### June 06, 2020\n\nInitial release of the Decision Review API\n",

Using `067` will change their POA code.\n- Updated test user representative John Doe's individual POA code to `072`.  [#320](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients/pull/320)\n-- Using John Doe's previous code of `A1H` will still work, but attempts to assign `A1H` to a Veteran test user will not change their POA code.

We are working on updating the new validations to allow spaces and reduce the number of errors returned. \n\nWhen those changes are made, we will turn on the new validations, post an updated release note, and send a notification to all consumers.\n\n\n---\n\n### May 17, 2021\n\n(v1) In order to further automate matches of submitted documents with Veterans downstream, the required Veteran First and Last name metadata fields now only allow alpha characters, dashes -, and forward slashes /. Additionally, these fields must be less than or equal to 50 characters. No numbers or other special characters may be submitted in these fields. \n\nSubmissions with invalid characters will receive Error Status DOC102  \"Invalid Veteran name (e.g. empty, invalid characters, or too long). Names must match the regular expression /^[a-zA-Z-/]{1,50}$/\"\n\n[#6882](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/pull/6882)\n\n\n---\n\n### April 02, 2021\n\n(v1) We added new error detail messages that provide additional detail for a small number of submissions returning the DOC202 ERROR code.\n* Unidentified Mail: We could not associate this submission with a Veteran. Please verify the identifying information and resubmit.\n* Duplicate Submission: This document was already uploaded, faxed, or mailed and was or is being processed. This is a duplicate submission and will not be processed.\n* Blank Document: The attachment contains no content. Please verify the attachment and resubmit, if needed.\n\n\n---\n\n### March 29, 2021\n\n(v0) Version 0.0.1 of the Benefits Intake API was removed on March 29, 2021. Refer to [version 1.0.0](https://developer.va.gov/explore/benefits/docs/benefits?version=current) of the API and related documentation. For more information, [contact us](https://developer.va.gov/support/contact-us) or visit our [Google Developer Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!forum/va-lighthouse).\n\n\n---\n\n### March 01, 2021\n\n(v1) The Benefits-Intake API now has a new claim/benefit selection option to help ensure submissions reach the correct business line so they can be processed as quickly as possible: [#6037](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/pull/6037)\n\nThe existing businessLine metadata field can be empty, or it can contain the code to indicate a document is related to one of these claim/benefit types:\n\nCMP – Compensation requests such as those related to disability, unemployment, and pandemic claims\nPMC – Pension requests including survivor’s pension\nINS – Insurance such as life insurance, disability insurance, and other health insurance\nEDU – Education benefits, programs, and affiliations\nVRE – Veteran Readiness \u0026 Employment such as employment questionnaires, employment discrimination, employment verification\nBVA – Board of Veteran Appeals\nFID – Fiduciary/financial appointee, including family member benefits\nOTH – Other (which will be routed to CMP)\n\nThis change is currently optional, but may become a required field in a future iteration of the API.\n\n\n---\n\n### November 30, 2020\n\n(v1) Added uploaded PDF metadata (page count, total pages, document count, and document dimensions) to the DB and in the HTTP response:\n* Database migration [#5380](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/pull/5380)\n*

        "releaseNotes": "### February 04, 2022\n\nWe added a new API to the developer portal. This API was previously the EVSS Data Reference Service. It allows consumers to look up the following data for use with benefits claims:\n\n- Contention types\n- Countries\n- Disabilities\n- Intake sites\n- Military pay types\n- Service branches\n- Special circumstances\n- States\n- VA medical treatment facilities\n\nThis API will return only the data that can be used for benefits claims. For example, this API may return only a subset of states or countries that apply to benefits claims.\n\nThere are some important differences between this API and the service it replaces:\n\n- The new service requires an API key. [Obtain one through this onboarding process](https://developer.va.gov/onboarding).\n- There are some stylistic changes to each endpoints’ response format:\n    * Contention Types\n      + \"contentionTypes\" array renamed to \"items\"\n    * Countries\n      + \"countries\" array renamed to \"items\"\n    * Disabilities\n      + \"disability\" array renamed to \"items\"\n      + \"classificationCode\" renamed to \"id\"\n      + \"id\" is type long\n      + \"endDate\" renamed to \"endDateTime\"\n      + \"endDateTime\" reported in YYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ format\n      + \"endDateTime\" always included, even if null\n    * Intake Sites\n      + \"intakeSites\" array renamed to \"items\"\n      + \"code\" renamed to \"id\"\n      + \"id\" is type long\n    * Military Pay Types\n      + \"militaryPayTypes\" array renamed to \"items\"\n    * Service Branches\n      + \"serviceBranches\" array renamed to \"items\"\n    * Special Circumstances\n      + \"specialCircumstances\" array renamed to \"items\"\n    * States\n      + \"states\" array renamed to \"items\"\n    * Treatment Centers\n      + \"facilities\" array renamed to \"items\"\n\n\n- Responses are in JSON instead of HTML.\n- Minor improvements to HTTPS Response Codes. (i.e. treatment centers invalid state was 200 and is now 400, new 429 rate limit errors, unauthorized 401, refer to [API specification](https://developer.va.gov/explore/benefits/docs/benefits_reference_data?version=current) for complete information).\n- For the treatment center endpoint, the optional “stateCode” query parameter must now be 2 capital letters, otherwise a 400 response is returned. Previously, a 200 with a blank array was returned.\n- Optional pagination is supported (new fields were added to in the responses even if the optional pagination parameters are not used for certain end points).\n- URLs for the services are changed. The legacy production URLs are https://www.ebenefits.va.gov:444/wss-referencedata-services-web/rest/referencedata/v1/`\u003cendpoint name\u003e` and the new production URLs are: https://api.va.gov/services/benefits-reference-data/v1/`\u003cendpoint name\u003e`.\n\n\nIt's important to know that with the new version, you will need to support backward compatibility. You should:\n- Be prepared to handle HTTP status codes not explicitly specified in endpoint definitions.\n- Be tolerant with unknown fields in the payload, ignore deserialization of new fields, but do not eliminate them from the payload if needed for subsequent PUT requests.\n- Follow the redirect when the server returns HTTP status code 301 (Moved Permanently).\n\n\nLearn more about this API by reviewing the [Benefits Reference Data API documentation](/explore/benefits/docs/benefits_reference_data).\n\nFor cross-reference purposes, the PR for this release is [#4015](https://tools.health.dev-developer.va.gov/jenkins/job/department-of-veterans-affairs/job/health-apis-deployer/job/d2/4015/).\n",

Options for operating_status are `normal, notice, limited, closed`; options for `additional_info` is a text string showing details of facility notices for visitors, such as messages about parking lot closures or floor visitation information.\n- `active_status` is deprecated and replaced with `operating_status`. It will be removed in version 1.\n\n [View code change(s)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/lighthouse-facilities/pull/58)\n \n Note: the Facilities API codebase was refactored and separated from the vets-api repository.\n\n\n---\n\n### December 06, 2019\n\nThe Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) identifier for each health facility is now available.\n- `visn` has been added to all `/facilities` endpoints. [View code change(s)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/pull/3609)\n- For non-health facilities, this will return as `null`.\n\n\n---\n\n### November 08, 2019\n\nThe `/nearby` endpoint received major changes.\n- Previously, the server retrieved an isochrone (a line connecting points of the same time) for a provided location and looked for facilities that fell within that polygon. Now the opposite is true: facilities have isochrones that are compared against the provided location. Users should see increased performance from this endpoint as a result.\n- Data about drive times now comes directly from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Responses may vary slightly from the previous implementation because of this switch.\n- The response schema has also changed. Instead of returning facility data from `/nearby`, the endpoint now provides `min_time` and `max_time` attributes for the matching polygons and links to endpoints that can be queried to retrieve full information about the associated facility. This schema change allows us to keep `/nearby` within v0 of the Facilities API instead of incrementing to v1. See the schema changes by [visiting the documentation](https://developer.va.gov/explore/facilities/docs/facilities).\n\n[View code change(s)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/pull/3512)\n\n\n---\n\n### October 23, 2019\n\nWhen including latitude and longitude parameters in a request to  `/facilities` the results are now sorted in ascending order by distance.\n-  Previously the facilities in the response were sorted by type first and then distance. Now the closest facilities to the requested location will be returned first regardless of type. [View code change(s)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/pull/3461)\n\n\n---\n\n### September 30, 2019\n\nYou can now see if Health facilities are mobile or temporarily deactivated.\n- Added `mobile` and `active_status` flags to the API response for Health facilities (other facility types will return `null` for these fields). Options for `mobile` are `true` or `false`; options for `active_status` are `A` for Active or `T` for Temporarily deactivated. [View code change(s)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/pull/3339/commits)\n  - Mobile facilities are subject to frequent address changes. To get the exact current location, please call the number listed.\n\n\n---\n\n### September 20, 2019\n\nYou can now query facilities in `/nearby` using latitude and longitude\n- As an alternative option to `address`, this adds the ability to make a request to `/va_facilities/v1/nearby` using `lat` and `lng` as input parameters.

You can now search by either ICN or National Provider Identifier (NPI) using `identifier`.\n\n\n---\n\n### January 27, 2022\n\nThe `manufacturer.display` field has been updated in the R4 `Immunization` resource. This field is populated based on CVX to manufacturer mappings from the [CDC Product Names to CVX and MVX code set](https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/vaccines.asp?rpt=tradename). In cases where a CVX code maps to multiple manufacturers, the exact manufacturer can't be determined and thus `manufacturer.display` will be omitted from the response.\n\n\n---\n\n### January 13, 2022\n\nAdded FHIR R4 `Encounter` Resource data, which includes the ability to search by `patient`, `date`, and `_lastUpdated` date.\n\nThe `vaccineCode` field in the R4 `Immunization` resource now includes the Vaccine Short Description as well as the Vaccine Group Code and Name based on the [CDC CVX to Vaccine Groups code set](https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/vaccines.asp?rpt=vg).\n\nAdded support for `_lastUpdated` search in the R4 `Observation` resource.\n\n\n---\n\n### January 10, 2022\n\n### January 10, 2022\nWe changed the `referenceRange` data field that is returned with the `Observation` resource.\n - It no longer returns the field `high` or `low` if there is not an associated value.\n - It now returns the `system`, `code`, and `unit` fields only if all data are present.\n\n\n---\n\n### December 13, 2021\n\nAdded support for `_lastUpdated` search in both the DSTU2 and R4 `Procedure` resource.\n\nIntegrated a new data source that contains COVID Vaccination data for VA Employees who received their vaccinations at a VA Facility.  This data is now available in the `Immunization` resource.\n\n\n---\n\n### November 16, 2021\n\nAdded `qualification.code.text` and `address.period` data fields to the `Practitioner` resource.\n\nAdded the `code.text` data field to the `PractitionerRole` resource.\n\n\n---\n\n### September 21, 2021\n\nWe added new elements and values to the R4 `Condition` FHIR mapping. \n  -  The `clinicalStatus` element now supports the value `inactive`.\n  -  The `verificationStatus` element now returns these additional values:`provisional`, `differential`, `confirmed`, and `refuted`. Previously, this element always returned  `unconfirmed`.\n  -  The `recorder` element is now added.\n\nThe R4 `AllergyIntolerance` FHIR mapping now includes both `clincalStatus` and `verificationStatus`.  Previously, only one was populated based on value. \n\nThe `primarySource` for the R4 `Immunization` FHIR mapping now supports Boolean values. Previously, it was always `true`.\n\n\n---\n\n### August 24, 2021\n\nAdded the `code` data to the R4 `AllergyIntolerance` resource to be compliant with [US Core Implementation Guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-allergyintolerance.html).\n\nUpdated the `Condition` resource to include [SNOMED CT](http://snomed.info/sct) and ICD-10-CM codings when both are available.\n\n\n---\n\n### May 04, 2021\n\nAdded an `identifier` to the `Organization` resource to represent the VA Facility to be consistent with the Facility ID used by the Facilities API. For example a VAMC has an identifier of the form `vha_[stationNumber]` like `vha_673`.\n\nAdded an `identifier` to the `Location` resource to represent the VA clinic. This `identifier` has the form `vha_[stationNumber]_[clinic identifier]`.\n\n\n---\n\n### February 24, 2021\n\nAdded the FHIR R4 resource `Appointment`, which includes the ability to search appointments by `Patient` and `Location` references and searching by `_lastUpdated` date.\n\n\n---\n\n### December 15, 2020\n\nThe following three R4 resources have been made available: `Device`, `Practitioner`, and `PractitionerRole`. Not all US Core searches are yet supported for `Practitioner` and `PractitionerRole`.\n\nThe hold times for `Immunization` and COVID 19 Lab Results have been eliminated.\n\n\n---\n\n### August 31, 2020\n\nIn adherence to changes per the [21st Century Cures Act](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/05/01/2020-07419/21st-century-cures-act-interoperability-information-blocking-and-the-onc-health-it-certification#h-13), the Veteran Health API profile, in line with the US Core Implementation Guide has added FHIR R4 resources to the R4 tab.\n\n\n---\n\n### August 07, 2020\n\nWe have updated the mock health records for test users in the Sandbox environment for the Veterans Health API `Condition` resource to list conditions from either SNOMED-CT or ICD-10 code sets.  Previously only SNOMED-CT codes were available.\n\n\n---\n\n### July 31, 2020\n\nWe are decreasing the data hold time for the Veterans Health API from 72 hours to 36 hours, effective July 31, 2020, based on an updated VHA policy.  When a physician enters or changes patient data, there is a holding period before the data is released and visible through other applications such as health apps. The holding period gives physicians time to contact their patients and discuss health data, such as sensitive diagnoses, before the patient sees this data elsewhere.

The data contains sample Veteran health records (both living and deceased) that mimic real Veteran demographics. The associated clinical resources include data generated from disease models covering up to a dozen of the most common Veteran afflictions.\n\nThe Community Care Eligibility API also allows a user/application to retrieve an array of different Veteran eligibilities from a synthetic dataset.\n\n## Development API access\n\nThe VA API Platform uses the [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) standard to allow Veterans to authorize third-party applications to access data on their behalf. Some Health APIs also use the [SMART on FHIR](http://docs.smarthealthit.org/) profile. Both OpenID Connect and SMART on FHIR are built on OAuth 2.\n\n### What is the criteria to be considered for Development API access?\n\nThe following basic information should be provided:\n\n * Your name\n * Email address\n * Organization name\n * OAuth Redirect URI\n\n### What happens after I am approved?\n\nYou will receive an email from the VA API team notifying you of your approval, and it will include a new Client ID and Secret for your application. The base URI for the Health API endpoints are:\n\n * `https://api.va.gov/services/fhir/v0/argonaut/data-query/`\n * `https://api.va.gov/services/fhir/v0/dstu2/`\n * `https://api.va.gov/services/fhir/v0/r4/`\n * `https://api.va.gov/services/community-care/v0/eligibility`\n\nAccordingly, the FHIR conformance statements can be retrieved from:\n\n * `https://api.va.gov/services/fhir/v0/argonaut/data-query/metadata`\n * `https://api.va.gov/services/fhir/v0/dstu2/metadata`\n * `https://api.va.gov/services/fhir/v0/r4/metadata`\n\nYou will also be provided with a set of test accounts to use that will allow you to access specific synthetic data patient records.\n\n## Developer Guidelines\n\nBelow are guidelines you should follow to be successful in your VA API integration.\n\n### Data Refresh\n\nThe APIs accessed via the Development environment are using the same underlying logic as VA’s production APIs; only the underlying data store is different. The synthetic data store is static and is not refreshed at the same intervals as production.\n\n### Usage\n\nAPI usage is not restricted within the Development environment.\n",

While these APIs allow greater access to health data, they do not currently allow submission of medical claims. \n\nVA’s Health APIs use [HL7’s Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) framework](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html) for providing healthcare data in a standardized format. FHIR solutions are built from a set of modular components, called resources, which can be easily assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical and administrative problems. \n\nWhen you register for access to the Health APIs, you will be granted access to a synthetic set of data (provided by the MITRE Corporation) that mimics real Veteran demographics. The associated clinical resources include data generated from disease models covering up to a dozen of the most common Veteran afflictions.
